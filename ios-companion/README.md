# Vishnu iPhone Companion

The iOS companion is the primary real-device companion for the owner's current setup.

The app also includes a cloud-first **Open Vishnu** route. It hands off to
Safari so the same Google sign-in, trusted-device cookie, microphone permissions,
voice experience and persistent conversations are shared with the web and desktop
surfaces. This repository can build and test an unsigned iOS Simulator artifact
without an Apple account. Installation on a physical iPhone and TestFlight still
require an Apple Developer team and Apple-issued signing assets.

## Implemented foundation

- SwiftUI iPhone app foundation (iOS 17+)
- existing Vishnu desktop pairing token + six-digit code flow
- device identity and bearer credential stored in iOS Keychain with `ThisDeviceOnly` protection
- HTTPS/WSS required by default; plaintext HTTP/WS is an explicit development-only opt-in
- authenticated `URLSessionWebSocketTask` command channel
- reconnect on foreground/active lifecycle and scheduled `BGAppRefreshTask` refresh attempts
- device info and battery commands
- local notification delivery command
- URL/universal-link/custom-scheme handoff; arbitrary app launch is not claimed because iOS restricts it
- active `AVAudioSession` voice/microphone foundation using voice-chat mode
- simulator CI workflow
- separate physical-iPhone validation workflow

## iOS lifecycle boundary

iOS normally suspends ordinary apps in the background. The companion therefore does not pretend that a WebSocket is permanently alive after the app is backgrounded. It reconnects when the app becomes active and can receive system-scheduled background refresh opportunities. Continuous background execution is reserved for legitimate Apple-supported modes, such as an active audio session.

A later push-notification stage can add production APNs wake/notification delivery for server-initiated mobile events.

## Pairing

1. Start Vishnu on the trusted computer and create the one-time pairing offer locally.
2. On iPhone, enter the computer's secure HTTPS address, pairing token, and six-digit code.
3. Pairing returns a device ID and bearer credential. The bearer is written to Keychain and is never placed in a URL.

For development on a trusted LAN only, the UI has an explicit insecure HTTP/WS toggle. Production should use trusted HTTPS/WSS.

## Generate project

```bash
cd ios-companion
brew install xcodegen
xcodegen generate
open PersonalAICompanion.xcodeproj
```

For a real iPhone, configure signing with an Apple Development team in Xcode. The physical-device GitHub workflow expects a self-hosted macOS runner with the iPhone attached plus `IOS_DEVICE_UDID` and `IOS_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` repository secrets.
