## Current state machine

`idle -> listening -> thinking -> acting -> speaking -> idle`

## Safety design

- Remote server is loopback-only by default.
- Remote commands require a paired bearer token.
- Pairing offers are one-time and expire.
- Tool risk is enforced below the model.
- Side effects are blocked by default in `ask` mode.
- Tool execution is audited in SQLite.
- Plugins are manifest-based; arbitrary in-process Python import is intentionally excluded.
