# Vishnu — Missing / Partial / Stub Matrix

Baseline date: 2026-09-16

This matrix separates repository/automated closure from physical-device, live-provider, signed-distribution and production evidence.

## P10 implementation closure

P10 branch: `p10/advanced-autonomy-qualification-20260916`. Draft PR #32 remains OPEN / DRAFT / UNMERGED. Exact start base: P9 evidence `0e1081751a7efafc9c9f35a2afb9c6d431875b92`. Frozen implementation: `4544df7a68d447871e17c3c2dc221efc12722abb`.

Repository/automated gap audit found no unexplained P10 MISSING/PARTIAL/STUB item after the final model-routing and governed-parameter repairs. Existing authorities are reused instead of duplicated: P6/W7 own consequential operations, approval, execution, verification, recovery and E-stop; P7 owns observation context; P8 owns continuity/device/session trust; P9 owns governed model routing; W8 owns model health/failover/observability; Memory and Knowledge remain separate canonical authorities.

Qualification: **54 P10 focused/adversarial/A-X/durability tests PASS**; full repository **1238 passed, 0 failed, 24 warnings**; encrypted recovery **15 passed**; compileall and `pip check` PASS; `pip-audit` no known vulnerabilities. Final 45-second P10 soak completed **6,330 iterations**, event history remained bounded at **500**, and SQLite integrity was `ok`.

Implementation exact-head gate at `4544df7a68d447871e17c3c2dc221efc12722abb`: CI #1221 / `35086639540`; Reliability/Security #303 / `35086639510`; P3 #241 / `35086639531`; Android #302 / `35086639552`; Package #302 / `35086639563`; iOS #284 / `35086639521` — **6/6 PASS**.

The only remaining P10 repository closure step at this document state is the documentation-only evidence exact-head six-workflow gate. Real local/external providers, physical devices/sensors, live background autonomy, live service and production remain intentionally deferred.
