# P8 — Governed Cross-Device Continuity / Everywhere Intelligence Checkpoint

Date: 2026-09-16
Branch: `p8/cross-device-continuity-qualification-20260916`
Draft PR: #30 (OPEN / DRAFT / UNMERGED)
P8 start/base (P7 evidence): `5f13ff2a994e2d257ba1c8d4d4f6cdd6a32d481e`
Final P8 implementation: `041584c50e2e2df8e74aa67843eebd2c2e0e058c`

## Classification

P8 implements governed continuity across existing Vishnu authorities. It does not create a second owner identity, device/session authority, conversation authority, memory authority, P7 world-understanding authority, P6/W7 action authority, approval authority, executor, recovery authority, or Emergency Stop authority.

Repository/automated implementation qualification is complete at the frozen implementation SHA. Physical cross-device, live-service and production qualification are intentionally deferred to final pre-release/W10 because the required physical environment is not currently available.

## Architecture and authority boundaries

- Identity/session/device trust remain owned by the existing identity, P3/device registry and session/security-epoch authorities.
- Conversation continuity reuses the canonical conversation/thread model.
- Memory continuity uses canonical memory/Second Brain references and does not introduce MemoryV2.
- P7 context continuity uses safe, freshness/retention/provenance-aware P7 projections; raw multimodal replication is not P8 authority.
- P6/W7 remain the only consequential-operation, approval, execution, verification, retry/recovery and Emergency Stop authorities. P8 exposes only safe status where permitted.
- Activities/audit reuse the existing event/audit authority.
- `PersonalAIEverywhere` remains a surface adapter over the governed continuity service rather than a new Vishnu system.

## Security and deterministic qualification

The committed P8 qualification covers trusted/unknown/revoked devices, valid/stale/wrong-device sessions, security-epoch invalidation, owner mismatch, duplicate delivery, malicious replay, deterministic ordering, offline/reconnect, offline revocation, memory deletion/non-resurrection, P7 expiry/deletion non-resurrection, secret-bearing payload rejection, P6/approval authority-transfer attempts and Emergency Stop preservation.

Deterministic A–L scenarios cover web→mobile, mobile→desktop, offline→reconnect, duplicate delivery, revoked offline device, security epoch change, canonical memory continuity, deleted-memory non-resurrection, safe P7 context continuity, expired/deleted P7 non-resurrection, safe P6 operation status without authority transfer, and Emergency Stop across valid surfaces.

Focused/security/E2E/performance regression suite: **46 passed**. Full repository regression evidence for this implementation content: **1,127 passed, 0 failed, 24 warnings**. Encrypted recovery qualification: **13 passed**. `pip check`, compileall and `pip-audit` passed; pip-audit reported no known vulnerabilities.

## Performance / boundedness

Qualification measurements for the P8 implementation content measured continuity ingestion at approximately **0.360 s / 1.862 s / 4.514 s** for 100 / 500 / 1,200 events. Restart was approximately **0.00046–0.00049 s** and bounded queries approximately **0.0031–0.0056 s**. These are qualification measurements, not production SLAs or real-model inference measurements. Persistence is query-bounded; P8 does not intentionally load the entire continuity history into a Python startup ledger.

Memory observations are process-level qualification observations only. Allocator/RSS retention is not called a leak without attribution, while unbounded P8 event/device/conversation mirrors remain prohibited by tests and architecture.

## Recovery / soak

Encrypted isolated backup/restore includes representative continuity/device/revocation/idempotency/conversation/memory/P7 state and verifies that revoked authority, deleted memory and expired/deleted P7 context do not regain authority after restore. Reliability soak exercises simulated multi-device resume, duplicate/reconciliation/offline/reconnect and authority checks with SQLite integrity validation.

## Implementation exact-head workflow gate

At exact head `041584c50e2e2df8e74aa67843eebd2c2e0e058c`, all six required pull-request workflow families completed successfully:

- CI #1146 / run `35060968775` — SUCCESS
- Reliability and Security #275 / run `35060968809` — SUCCESS
- P3 iPhone PWA #227 / run `35060968854` — SUCCESS
- Android Instrumentation #274 / run `35060968800` — SUCCESS
- Package Validation #274 / run `35060968904` — SUCCESS
- iOS Companion #256 / run `35060968741` — SUCCESS

Implementation gate: **6/6 SUCCESS**.

The additional CI push run #1145 / `35060875217` also completed successfully at the same SHA but is not substituted for the six-family PR gate.

## Evidence classes / deferred physical qualification

Repository/automated evidence and physical/live/production evidence are separate.

- `P8_IMPLEMENTED = YES`
- `P8_INTEGRATED = YES`
- `P8_AUTOMATED_VALIDATED = YES` after this documentation-only evidence head itself passes the required six exact-head workflows.
- `P8_REPOSITORY_AUTOMATED_SCOPE_COMPLETE = YES` only after that evidence-head gate.
- `REAL_IPHONE_CROSS_DEVICE_VERIFIED = NO`
- `REAL_ANDROID_CROSS_DEVICE_VERIFIED = NO`
- `REAL_DESKTOP_CROSS_DEVICE_VERIFIED = NO`
- `PHYSICAL_CROSS_DEVICE_VERIFIED = NO`
- `LIVE_SERVICE_VERIFIED = NO`
- `PRODUCTION_VERIFIED = NO`

Automated iOS/Android/PWA workflow names are not physical-device evidence. Physical cross-device qualification is intentionally deferred to final pre-release/W10.
