## P10 Advanced Autonomy — Frozen implementation qualification

Start base: exact P9 evidence `0e1081751a7efafc9c9f35a2afb9c6d431875b92`.
Branch: `p10/advanced-autonomy-qualification-20260916`.
Draft PR: #32, OPEN / DRAFT / UNMERGED.
Frozen implementation SHA: `4544df7a68d447871e17c3c2dc221efc12722abb`.

### Authority and architecture qualification

P10 keeps `AdvancedAutonomy` as the canonical orchestration layer and introduces no competing security/execution authorities. Goals and structured plans are bounded and durable; task IDs/dependencies/depth/capabilities/retries are validated; model-generated plans remain untrusted. P10 delegates consequential operations to P6/W7, verification/recovery to W7, world context to P7, continuity/trust to P8, model computation to P9 and health/failover/observability through W8. Memory and Knowledge remain separate authorities. Emergency Stop and owner control remain authoritative.

### Focused / adversarial / deterministic E2E A-X

Committed P10 qualification includes:

- `tests/test_p10_advanced_autonomy.py`
- `tests/test_p10_adversarial.py`
- `tests/test_p10_e2e.py`
- `tests/test_p10_performance_recovery.py`
- `tests/p10_soak.py`

Combined exact-head Reliability result: **54 passed**.

A-X deterministic coverage:

A — simple goal → structured plan → completion — PASS
B — multi-step dependency order — PASS
C — parallel safe readiness/isolation — PASS
D — approval-required waits before execution — PASS
E — approval denial prevents operation — PASS
F — governed tool failure remains bounded — PASS
G — model failure uses canonical P9/W8 behavior — PASS
H — LOCAL_ONLY does not gain external fallback — PASS
I — bounded authorized Memory context — PASS
J — Knowledge remains separate from Memory — PASS
K — fresh bounded P7 context provides context, not authority — PASS
L — P8 continuity/trust composition preserves boundaries — PASS
M — malicious model/fake approval cannot grant authority — PASS
N — subordinate agent cannot expand capability — PASS
O — malicious tool/result text cannot alter authority — PASS
P — restart does not blindly replay active consequential state — PASS
Q — verification failure does not become success — PASS
R — uncertain outcome routes through canonical recovery semantics — PASS
S — cancellation stops queued work — PASS
T — Emergency Stop blocks consequential work — PASS
U — concurrent goals/owners remain isolated — PASS
V — dependency cycles/unbounded planning loops blocked — PASS
W — oversized task/depth/history/context resources bounded — PASS
X — proactive suggestion remains suggestion, not execution — PASS

Additional adversarial qualification covers duplicate IDs, unknown/self dependencies, cross-owner isolation, fake approval language, broken E-stop provider fail-closed behavior, nested telemetry secrets, model capability escalation, parameter sanitization and cancellation/restart boundaries.

### Concurrency / durability / recovery

The P10 shared SQLite persistence defect discovered by qualification was repaired rather than weakening concurrency tests. Short durable DB operations are synchronized; locks are not held across model/tool/network/approval/verification/recovery waits. Qualification exercises concurrent goal/plan creation, event writes, multiple owners, concurrent reads/writes, no lost goal/plan records, bounded event history and `PRAGMA integrity_check`.

Restart qualification verifies active RUNNING/VERIFYING/RECOVERING state becomes safe `UNCERTAIN` rather than blindly rerunning consequential work. READY/PAUSED/CANCELLED/COMPLETED durable semantics are preserved according to their lifecycle contracts.

Encrypted isolated backup/restore/recovery: **15 passed**. P10 durable state participates in repository recovery qualification without introducing plaintext secrets or restoring runtime model/provider authority.

### Full repository / security / package

Full repository exact-head result: **1238 passed, 0 failed, 24 warnings**.

- P10 focused/adversarial/A-X/durability: **54 passed**
- encrypted isolated recovery: **15 passed**
- `pip-audit -r requirements.txt`: **PASS — no known vulnerabilities**
- compileall: **PASS**
- CI `pip check`: **PASS**
- canonical platform/package regression workflows: **PASS**

No frozen W7/W8/P9 guard was removed, skipped or weakened to obtain P10 qualification.

### Performance / boundedness

Qualification-environment P10 orchestration measurements previously recorded at the final implementation lineage include approximately:

| Measurement | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| 100 goal creations | ~0.178 s |
| 100 plan creations/validation | ~0.271 s |
| 1,000 readiness computations | ~0.015 s |
| restart recovery | ~0.0005 s |
| bounded event history | 500 |

These measure deterministic orchestration/database overhead and are not model inference, tool/network latency or production SLAs.

### P10 mixed soak

Final 45-second exact-head P10 soak:

- iterations: **6,330**
- bounded event history: **500**
- SQLite integrity: **ok**
- repeated goal/plan creation and transitions exercised
- replanning/cancellation/Emergency Stop/restart/proactivity exercised
- no uncontrolled duplicate side-effect claim is made; deterministic repository adapters only

No real AI provider, physical device or deployed long-running autonomy was used.

### Evidence boundary

The P10 evidence lineage may change documentation only. The second exact-head six-workflow evidence gate is required before P10 repository/automated scope is declared complete.
