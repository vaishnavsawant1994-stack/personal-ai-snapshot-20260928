# Vishnu — Capability Matrix

Baseline date: 2026-09-16

Statuses distinguish automated repository evidence from live service, real local/external model, physical-device, signed-distribution and production evidence. Automated mocks, simulators and deterministic provider adapters are never classified as physical/live provider proof.

## P10 Advanced Autonomy implementation qualification

P10 starts exactly from P9 evidence `0e1081751a7efafc9c9f35a2afb9c6d431875b92` on `p10/advanced-autonomy-qualification-20260916`, draft PR #32. Frozen implementation: `4544df7a68d447871e17c3c2dc221efc12722abb`.

`AdvancedAutonomy` is orchestration-only. It owns bounded goals, structured plans, dependency scheduling, replanning, owner pause/resume/cancel, suggestions, worker-agent metadata and durable orchestration state. It does not become identity, permission, approval, execution, verification, recovery, Emergency Stop, Memory, Knowledge, world-context, continuity, model-routing or model-health authority.

P10 composes through P6/W7 for consequential operations, approvals, verification and recovery; P7 for bounded observation context; P8 for trusted continuity; P9 for advisory governed model computation; and W8 through P9 for health/failover/observability. Model, agent and tool output remain untrusted and cannot grant authority. LOCAL_ONLY does not gain external fallback.

Implementation qualification: **54 P10 focused/adversarial/A-X/durability tests PASS**; full repository **1238 passed, 0 failed, 24 warnings**; encrypted recovery **15 passed**; compileall and `pip check` PASS; `pip-audit` reports no known vulnerabilities. Concurrency qualification covers shared SQLite persistence, owner/plan isolation, concurrent event writes and SQLite integrity. Nested telemetry sanitization removes sensitive keys recursively and history is bounded.

Final 45-second P10 soak: **6,330 iterations**, bounded event history **500**, SQLite integrity `ok`; deterministic goal/plan transitions, cancellation, replanning, E-stop, restart and proactivity exercised. These are repository qualification measurements, not production/live autonomy evidence.

Implementation exact-head workflows at `4544df7a68d447871e17c3c2dc221efc12722abb`:

- CI #1221 / `35086639540` — PASS
- Reliability and Security #303 / `35086639510` — PASS
- P3 iPhone PWA #241 / `35086639531` — PASS
- Android Instrumentation #302 / `35086639552` — PASS
- Package Validation #302 / `35086639563` — PASS
- iOS Companion #284 / `35086639521` — PASS

Implementation gate: **6/6 PASS**. Evidence remains documentation-only until the second exact-head gate completes.

## Frozen authority boundaries

W7 remains consequential-action/transaction/approval/verification/recovery/Emergency Stop authority. W8 remains model health/failover/observability authority. Second Brain remains Memory authority. Knowledge remains distinct from Memory. P7 remains world-understanding context authority. P8 remains trusted continuity/device/session authority. P9 decides which eligible intelligence resource may compute a result and never grants permission. P10 plans and orchestrates but does not gain unrestricted authority. The owner remains authoritative.
