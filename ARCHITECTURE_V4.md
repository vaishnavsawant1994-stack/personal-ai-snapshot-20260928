Security invariants: pairing initiation remains loopback-only; device API requires device id + bearer token; WebSocket tokens stay in headers; destructive/external tools remain governed by the V3 permission engine; dashboard tool execution cannot bypass confirmation policy; vault data uses AES-GCM with an scrypt-derived key; updates require Ed25519-signed manifests and SHA-256 package verification.
